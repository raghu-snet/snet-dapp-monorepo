      <p>
        <strong>1. Welcome to SingularityNET</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.1</strong> These terms and conditions along with the Privacy Policy constitute a contract (&ldquo;
        <strong>Agreement</strong>&rdquo;) between you and Stichting SingularityNET, whose registered office is at
        Barbara Strozzilaan 362, 1083 HN Amsterdam, the Netherlands (&ldquo;<strong>SingularityNET</strong>&rdquo;).
        This Agreement governs your use of SingularityNET&rsquo;s services (&ldquo;<strong>Services</strong>&rdquo;),
        through which you can buy, get, license, rent or subscribe to AI tools, applications and services (&ldquo;
        <strong>AI</strong>
        <strong>TApp</strong>&rdquo;), and other services (&ldquo;<strong>Content</strong>&rdquo;). If you are entering
        into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to
        bind such entity, its members, its administrative users, and its affiliates to this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.2</strong> Terms found in this Agreement that relate to Services, Content types, features or
        functionality not available in your home country (&ldquo;<strong>Home Country</strong>&rdquo;) are not
        applicable to you unless and until they become available to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.3</strong> You must be at least 16 years old (or equivalent minimum age in your Home Country) to use
        our Services. If you are younger than 16 ask your parents for AI books, in the meantime. Children under the age
        of majority should review this Agreement with their parent or guardian to ensure that the child and parent or
        legal guardian understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.4</strong> We always try our best at what we do and promise that we will exercise reasonable care and
        skill in performing our obligations under this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.5</strong> This Agreement may be saved and printed through the options of your web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Our Services and how they work </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.1</strong> Our Services are:
      </p>
      <p>
        (<strong>i</strong>) AI Store (&ldquo;<strong>AI Store</strong>&rdquo;) &ndash; a decentralized marketplace for
        Artificial Intelligence (&ldquo;<strong>AI</strong>&rdquo;). Through the AI Store AI developers can exchange
        their tools and services for SingularityNET&rsquo;s AGIX token (&ldquo;<strong>AGIX</strong>&rdquo;) or even for
        other tools and services. To make these transactions as simple as possible, SingularityNET provides APIs to
        incorporate standard AI services, like image and language processing, into smart contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.2</strong> Using our Services and accessing your Content may require a SingularityNET ID (&ldquo;
        <strong>SNET ID</strong>&rdquo;). A SNET ID is the account you use across SingularityNET&rsquo;s ecosystem. You
        are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality and security. SingularityNET is not responsible for any
        losses arising from the unauthorized use of your SNET ID. Please contact SingularityNET as soon as possible if
        you suspect that your SNET ID has been compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.3</strong> SNET IDs for persons under age 16 (or equivalent minimum age in your Home country) can be
        created by a parent or legal guardian.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.4</strong> With the exception of people or businesses expressly authorized to create accounts on
        behalf of their employers or clients, we prohibit the creation of and you agree that you will not create a SNET
        ID for anyone other than yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.5</strong> When you hold AGIX you may be given the option to &ldquo;stake&rdquo; AGIX and earn a
        reward (please visit our <u>staking information page</u> for further details).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Use of Services and Content</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.1</strong> Your use of the Services and Content must follow the rules set forth in this section
        (&ldquo;<strong>Rules</strong>&rdquo;). Any other use of the Services and Content is a material breach of this
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.2</strong> You may use the Services and Content only for commercial purposes (except as set forth
        below). SingularityNET&rsquo;s delivery of Content does not constitute a grant or waiver of any rights of the
        copyright owners. It is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage Content. You may not tamper with or
        circumvent any security technology included with the Services. You may access our Services only using
        SingularityNET&rsquo;s software, and may not modify or use modified versions of such software.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.3</strong> You can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge (either of which is
        referred to as a &ldquo;<strong>Transaction</strong>&rdquo;). Each Transaction is an electronic contract between
        you and SingularityNET, and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services. However, if you are a
        customer of Stichting SingularityNET and you acquire an AI TApp, Stichting SingularityNET may be the merchant of
        record; this means that you may acquire the Content from Stichting SingularityNET, and it is licensed by the AI
        TApp Dev (as defined below). SingularityNET will charge your payment method for any paid Transactions, including
        any applicable taxes. If we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient
        funds), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as
        you may update your payment method information. All Transactions are final. Content prices may change at any
        time. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole remedy is
        either replacement of the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by SingularityNET. From time to
        time, SingularityNET may refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other
        manipulative behavior that entitles SingularityNET to a corresponding counterclaim.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.4</strong> Our Services may allow you to submit materials such as images, videos, audio files and text
        documents. Your use of such features must comply with the submission guidelines (&ldquo;
        <strong>Submissions Guidelines</strong>&rdquo;) under 3.4.1. Please contact SingularityNET as soon as possible,
        if you see materials that do not comply with the Submissions Guidelines. You hereby grant SingularityNET a
        worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, nonexclusive license to use the materials you submit within the Services and
        related marketing, and SingularityNET internal purposes. SingularityNET may monitor and decide to remove or edit
        any submitted material.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.4.1</strong> Submissions Guidelines. You may not use the Services to: (i) submit any materials that
        you do not have permission, right or license to use; (ii) submit objectionable, offensive, unlawful, deceptive
        or harmful content; (iii) submit personal, private or confidential information belonging to others; (iv) request
        personal information from a minor; (v) impersonate or misrepresent your affiliation with another person, or
        entity; (vi) pretend to actually be Ben Goertzel; (vii) submit or transmit spam, including but not limited to
        unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, or informational announcements; (vii) plan or
        engage in any illegal, fraudulent, or manipulative activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.5</strong> SingularityNET may monitor your use of the Services and Content to ensure that you are
        following these Rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. AI TApps </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.1</strong> The term AI TApp includes AI tools, services, apps, in-app purchases, extensions, and
        subscriptions made available in an AI TApp.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.2</strong> AI TApp licenses are provided to you by SingularityNET or a third party developer (&ldquo;
        <strong>AI TApp Dev</strong>&rdquo;). If you are a customer of SingularityNET, the merchant of record may be
        Stichting SingularityNET, which means that you may acquire the AI TApp license from Stichting SingularityNET,
        but the AI TApp is licensed by the AI TApp Dev. An AI TApp licensed by SingularityNET is a &ldquo;
        <strong>SNET TApp</strong>&rdquo;; an AI TApp licensed by an AI TApp Dev is a &ldquo;
        <strong>Third Party App</strong>&rdquo;. SingularityNET acts as a mere intermediary for AI TApp Devs in
        providing the AI Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the AI TApp
        Dev. Any AI TApp that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (&ldquo;
        <strong>EULA</strong>&rdquo;) set forth below, unless SingularityNET or the AI TApp Dev provides an overriding
        custom license agreement (&ldquo;<strong>Custom EULA</strong>&rdquo;). The AI TApp Dev of any Third Party App is
        solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App. You
        acknowledge and agree that SingularityNET is a third-party beneficiary of the EULA or Custom EULA applicable to
        each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.3</strong> Some AI TApps may be sold together as a bundle (&ldquo;<strong>AI TApp Bundle</strong>
        &rdquo;). The price displayed with an AI TApp Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the AI
        TApp Bundle. The AI TApp Bundle price may be reduced to account for AI TApps you have already purchased or
        acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the AI TApp Bundle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.4</strong> The Services and certain AI TApps may allow you to purchase access to Content or services
        on a subscription basis (&ldquo;<strong>Subscriptions</strong>&rdquo;). Subscriptions automatically renew until
        cancelled. We will notify you if the price of a Subscription increases and, if required, seek your consent to
        continue. You will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the start of the latest Subscription period. If we
        cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not
        cancelled the Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge
        the payment method as you may update your payment method information. This may result in a change to the start
        of your next Subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period. Certain
        Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method. If you decide to unsubscribe from a
        Subscription before we start charging your payment method, cancel the subscription before the free trial ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.5</strong> The Services and certain AI TApps may allow you to purchase access to Content or services
        on a microtransaction basis (&ldquo;<strong>Microtransations</strong>&rdquo;). You will be charged no more than
        48 hours after the Microtransaction. If we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration
        or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled the purchase, you remain responsible for any uncollected
        amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as you may update your payment method information.
        Certain Microtransactions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method. If you decide not to
        purchase the Content or services before we start charging your payment method, cancel the Microtransaction
        before the free trial ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.6</strong> AI TApps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such AI TApps (&ldquo;
        <strong>In-App Purchases</strong>&rdquo;).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.7</strong> SingularityNET is responsible for providing maintenance and support for SNET TApps only, or
        as required under applicable law. AI TApp Devs are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third
        Party Apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. EULA </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.1 </strong>AI TApps made available through the AI Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license
        to each AI TApp is subject to your prior acceptance of either this EULA, or a Custom EULA, if one is provided.
        Your license to any SNET TApp under this EULA or Custom EULA is granted by SingularityNET, and your license to
        any Third Party App under this EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the AI TApp Dev of that Third Party App. Any AI
        TApp that is subject to this EULA is referred to herein as the &ldquo;<strong>Licensed TApp</strong>&rdquo;. The
        AI TApp Dev or SingularityNET as applicable (&ldquo;<strong>Licensor</strong>&rdquo;) reserves all rights in and
        to the Licensed TApp not expressly granted to you under this EULA.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.2 </strong>This EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this EULA
        will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.3 </strong>Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed TApp. The terms of
        this EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed TApp
        as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed TApp, unless such
        upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA. You agree that you will not use these products for any purposes
        prohibited by the law, including, without limitation, (i) the development, design, manufacture, or production of
        nuclear, missile, or chemical or biological weapons;(ii) the development, design, manufacture, or production of
        tools that could result in the fall of organized civilization; (iii) the development, design, manufacture, or
        production of tools that can put people or animals under risks of physical or emotional and psychological harm;
        (iv) the development, design, manufacture, or production of tools that allow people to impersonate Ben Goertzel;
        (v) the development, design, manufacture, or production of tools to commit terrorist offences. Except as
        provided in the Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed TApp available over a different AI platform.
        You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to
        derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed TApp, any updates, or any part
        thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to
        the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with
        the Licensed TApp).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.4</strong> You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information &ndash;
        including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and
        peripherals &ndash; that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product
        support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed TApp. Licensor may use this information, as
        long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or
        technologies to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.5</strong> The Licensed TApp may enable access to Licensor&rsquo;s and/or third-party services and
        websites (collectively and individually, &ldquo;<strong>External Services</strong>&rdquo;). You agree to use the
        External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or
        accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External
        Services. Data displayed by any Licensed TApp or External Service, including but not limited to financial,
        medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor
        or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
        EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party. You agree not to use the
        External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not
        responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country,
        and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such
        External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Licensor reserves the
        right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at
        any time without notice or liability to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.6</strong>{" "}
        <strong>
          You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Licensed TApp is at your sole risk. To the maximum extent
          permitted by applicable law, the Licensed TApp and any services performed or provided by the Licensed TApp are
          provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo;, with all faults and without warranty of any kind,
          and licensor hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions with respect to the Licensed TApp and any
          services, either express, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties and/or
          conditions of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, of fitness for a particular purpose, of accuracy, of
          quiet enjoyment, and of noninfringement of third-party rights. No oral or written information or advice given
          by licensor or its authorized representative shall create a warranty. Should the Licensed TApp or services
          prove defective, you assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction. Some
          jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights
          of a consumer, so the above exclusion and limitations may not apply to you.

        <strong>5.7</strong>{" "}
        <strong>
          To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event shall licensor be liable for personal injury or any
          incidental, special, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, damages for
          loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, or any other commercial damages or losses, arising out
          of or related to your use of or inability to use the Licensed TApp, however caused, regardless of the theory
          of liability (contract, tort, or otherwise) and even if licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
          damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for personal injury, or of incidental or
          consequential damages, so this limitation may not apply to you

          5.7.1 In no event shall Licensor&rsquo;s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required
          by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00). The
          foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.9.2</strong> Specifically excluded from application to this Agreement is the United Nations Convention
        on the International Sale of Goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.9.3</strong> To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim, past,
        present, or future, between us, including without limitation any dispute or claim related to or arising out of
        this Agreement (&ldquo;<strong>Dispute</strong>&rdquo;), you and us may attempt to negotiate any Dispute
        informally (the &ldquo;<strong>Informal Negotiations</strong>&rdquo;) before initiating any arbitration or Court
        proceeding. Such Informal Negotiations will commence upon written notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.9.4 </strong>If a Dispute is not resolved through Informal Negotiations and you live in the EU, you
        and us agree to try to resolve any and all Disputes, using the EU Online Dispute Resolution platform to reach an
        out-of-court settlement. The EU Online Dispute Resolution platform is developed and operated by the European
        Commission. The EU Online Dispute Resolution platform is user-friendly, multilingual and accessible to all.
        Everything is done in four, simple steps:
      </p>
      <p>
        (<strong>i</strong>) You fill in an online complaint form and submits it;
      </p>
      <p>
        (<strong>ii</strong>) the complaint is sent to Us;
      </p>
      <p>
        (<strong>iii</strong>) Once You and Us agree on an Alternative Dispute Resolution entity to handle the dispute,
        the EU Online Dispute Resolution platform transfers automatically the complaint to that entity;
      </p>
      <p>
        (<strong>iv</strong>) The Alternative Dispute Resolution entity handles the case entirely online and reaches an
        outcome in 90 days.

        <strong>6.9.5</strong> If you do not live in the EU or if a Dispute is not resolved through Informal
        Negotiations or the European Commission&rsquo;s Online Dispute Resolution platform, you and us agree on the
        following:
      </p>
      <p>
        (<strong>i</strong>) Binding Arbitration. Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action,
        demands or proceedings (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>Disputes</strong>&rdquo;) in which either party seeks to
        bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged
        unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names,
        logos, trade secrets or patents,{" "}
        <strong>
          the parties (a) waive respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement
          resolved in a court, and (b) waive respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, the parties will arbitrate
          Disputes through binding arbitration
        </strong>{" "}
        (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final
        and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).
      </p>
      <p>
        (<strong>ii</strong>) No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions.{" "}
        <strong>
          Any Dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement is personal and will be resolved solely through
          individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of
          representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempt to
          resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot
          be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on
          behalf of any other individual or group of individuals
        </strong>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        (<strong>iii</strong>) Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution. Each party will notify the other party in writing
        of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can
        attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to SingularityNET shall be sent by e-mail at{" "}
        <strong>legal@singularitynet.io</strong>. Notice to you shall be by email to the email address provided to
        SingularityNET. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (b)
        a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you
        are seeking. If you and us cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice
        is received by the applicable party, then either you or us may, as appropriate and in accordance with this
        section commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in section 6.9.5(i), file
        a claim in court.
      </p>
      <p>
        (<strong>iv</strong>) Process. Any arbitration will occur in the Netherlands. Arbitration will be conducted
        confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Netherlands Arbitration
        Institute (&ldquo;<strong>NAI Rules</strong>&rdquo;) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be
        incorporated by reference in this clause. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The courts located
        in the Netherlands will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration
        award.
      </p>
      <p>
        (<strong>v</strong>) Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and
        jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination
        of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available
        in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a
        representative action, which is prohibited by this Agreement. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual
        arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual&rsquo;s claims, preside over any type of class or
        representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        (<strong>vi</strong>) NAI Rules. NAI rules and additional information about the Netherlands Arbitration
        Institute are available on the Netherlands Arbitration Institute website (http://www.nai-nl.org). By agreeing to
        be bound by this Agreement, you either (i) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the NAI
        rules, or (ii) waive your opportunity to read the NAI rules and any claim that the NAI rules are unfair or
        should not apply for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.9.6</strong> <strong>Unilateral hybrid jurisdiction</strong>.{" "}
        <strong>
          In the event that SingularityNET does not rely on arbitration, it reserves the right to bring an action before
          the Dutch Courts, the Courts of your domicile or any other court, in which case the competent jurisdiction law
          shall be applicable
        </strong>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.9.7</strong> <strong>Time limitation</strong>.{" "}
        <strong>
          You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your business relationship with us must be
          filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred
        </strong>
